Sqlg Documentation
==================

v1.3.3, December 2016:

*Sqlg* is a implementation of 'http://tinkerpop.apache.org/[Apache TinkerPop]' on a 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system[RDBMS]'.
Currently 'http://www.postgresql.org/[Postgresql]', 'http://hsqldb.org/[HSQLDB]', and 'http://h2database.com[H2 database]' are supported.

== Introduction

Sqlg primary challenge is to reduce latency by combining TinkerPop 'http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#graph-traversal-steps[steps]'
into as few as possible database calls. The fine grained nature of graph traversals makes this crucial else the remote
call latency has a severe performance impact.

Additionally for Postgresql it has various bulk modes to reduce latency when modifying the graph.
